I am about to join LightSpeed Studios, Tencent.

Before that, I obtained my M.Sc. degree at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Guoping Wang. I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University in 2017.

My primary research interests lie in the field of computer graphics, focusing on geometry processing, real-time rendering, and physics-based simulation. I also have experience in computer-aided design, remote sensing, and visual localization.

I am proficient in various programming languages and tools, such as C++, Python, UE, etc., which have been instrumental in my research and development work.
